    <h1>Git</h1>
    <p>Git is a version control system that allows you to manage and keep track of your source code history.</p>
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>You can install Git by visiting the official Git website. On the download page, you will find options for installing Git on Windows, macOS, or Linux.</p>
    <h2>Branches</h2>
    <p>Branches allow you to move back and forth between 'states' of a project. By default, a repository has a 'master' branch (a 'trunk'), but you can create new branches at any time. You can create a new branch using the following command:</p>
    <pre>git checkout -b &lt;branch-name&gt;</pre>
    <p>Once you have created a new branch, you can start working on that branch by checking it out using the following command:</p>
    <pre>git checkout &lt;branch-name&gt;</pre>
    <p>After you have made changes to the new branch, you can add those changes to the branch using the following command:</p>
    <pre>git add .</pre>
    <p>Next, you would want to commit those changes to the branch with the following command:</p>
    <pre>git commit -m "A message describing the changes you made"</pre>
    <p>After committing the changes, you can push the branch to the remote repository with the following command:</p>
    <pre>git push origin &lt;branch-name&gt;</pre>

    <h2>Collaboration</h2>
    <p>One of the main reasons to use Git is for collaboration. To collaborate with other developers on a Git project, you will need to use remote repositories. A remote repository is a Git repository that is hosted on the Internet or another network. You can even use popular Git hosting site like GitHub to host your remote repositories.</p>
    <p>To collaborate with other developers, you should first clone their repository using the following command:</p>
    <pre>git clone &lt;url&gt;</pre>
    <p>After you have made changes to the project, you can push those changes to the remote repository so that the other
